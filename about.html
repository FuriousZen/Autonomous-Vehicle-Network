    <p class="aboutbout">Autonomous vehicles, commonly referred to as self-driving cars, are vehicles that operate entirely under their own technological components without human intervention. These vehicles have become the forefront of development for many software companies such as Waymo and Nvidia, as not only are autonomous vehicles convenient for the driver, but also pose a potent solution to energy consumption and road collisions. To achieve completely autonomous driving, these vehicles are frequently equipped with complex neural networks and advanced camera scanning systems to detect objects and roadside systems. However, with the emergence of advanced fifth-generation mobile communication (5G) and a potential transition to 6G in the near future, perhaps equally as promising is the incorporation of autonomous vehicles into an interconnected networking database. Using this method, connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) would no longer have to ‘react’ to those ahead or behind them, as they would become entirely synced with minimal latency between each other. This proves extremely beneficial in reducing traffic and optimizing travel times and energy efficiency on the Nonetheless, before such a network is implemented in a large city, it must first prove reliable and optimal on smaller-scale infrastructure such as multi-lane roads and intersections. Hence, this project aims to simulate the applications of a AVN on a single-lane road and builds the framework for a coordinated four-way intersection.
